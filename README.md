# NetTool
Small tool for doing stuff on networks <br>
I mean the main thing it does is find the admin panel urls for printers that broadcast it on the network <br>
to do that:
```bash
sudo ./netTool -findprinters
```
the way it gets URLs from the packet data is really disgusting and horrible <br>
i should fix that sometime i think
